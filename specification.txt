Design
==================================

 The CSV file needs six columns 

Col 1 - Company 
Col 2 - Symbol 
Col 3 - Date -- the date entered as the argument, in the form xx-yyy, where xx is the day as a digit, and yyy is the 3-letter abbrev. of the month.
Col 4 - Time -- as a special one letter code, defined below:

	if ( Col 4 = "After Market Close")
		 Col4 = A
	else if ( Col 4 = "Before Market Open")
		 Col4 = B
	else if ( Col 4 = "Time Not Supplied")
		 Col4 = U
	else if ( col 4 has a time supplied in form of ????)
		 Col4 = D
	else
		 Col4 = U

In order to get the entire text of the column without html, I will need to use DOMDocument methods.
 
Col 5 - Eps Estimate
Col 6 - PrevYr  -- a column with the string "Add"

Output in  CSV format:
Acorn International Inc, ATV, 19-Mar, B, N/A, Add

Output explanation:      
Company:Acorn International Inc 
Symbol: ATV
Date:19-Mar
Time:B
Eps: N/A
PrevYr:Add

------ Logic to get one letter code for Time ---
Col 4 -
If ( Col 4 = After Market Close)
 Col4 = A
If ( Col 4 = Before Market Open)
 Col4 = B
If ( Col 4 = Time Not Supplied)
 Col4 = U
If ( col 4 is supplied)
 Col4 = D
else
 Col4 = U
