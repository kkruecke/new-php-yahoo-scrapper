Just returned from the Urologist. It is his opinion that I will need to =
Cather for =

the rest of my life. I'm not convinced. We will see. The cancer has not =
demonstrated its =

presence in any way except my difficulty with urination. I took a PSA bl=
ood test today =

and that result will be available in a few days. I feel positive about t=
he future and the =

present considering I was diagnosed with stage four aggressive Prostate =
Cancer in =

January. The only traditional treatment that was offered was Hormone The=
rapy and =

Chemotherapy because of the aggressive and advanced nature of my cancer.=
 This treatment =

was offered only to extend my life by months; not as a cure. I didn't fe=
el like I was =

gambling much when I choose an alternative treatment that offered a poss=
ibility of curing =

my cancer, and no serious side effects. The treatment I have chosen is n=
ot compatible =

with the traditional treatment, therefore it is either one or the other.=
 I had been =

studying about how to deal with cancer for months before my diagnosis, t=
herefore my =

decision was clear. I feel tired a lot and my appetite is not good. I ha=
ve lost some =

weight, but nothing to be concerned about. I appreciate the prayers offe=
red for my =

recovery, and I am thankful that I am not suffering. =


Thankfully,
