Bug: While validate_url() seems to always work, file_get_contents() in the YahooTable ctor fails  
intermittantly. This is because file_get_contents() failed on a valid url. 

Prospective solution: Use Guzzle
http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

This will require installing Guzzle using composer together with the curl extension for php5. It will also require making the Yahoo project work with the
composer autoloader. 

1. To install Guzzle:

   $ composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

2. Install or enable the php5 curl extension:

   $ sudo aptitude install php5-curl

3. Read the bookmarks on how Composer works
