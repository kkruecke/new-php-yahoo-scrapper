Former bug: ile_get_contents() in the YahooTable ctor failed intermittently.  
Current solution: added loop to try twice.

Alternative solution: Use Guzzle instead of file_get_contents()

Requirements for Guzzle solution:

This will require installing Guzzle using composer together with the curl extension for php5. It will also require making the Yahoo project work with the
composer autoloader. 

1. To install Guzzle:

   $ composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

2. Install or enable the php5 curl extension:

   $ sudo aptitude install php5-curl

3. Read the bookmarks on how Composer works

4. Read Guzzle howtos.
