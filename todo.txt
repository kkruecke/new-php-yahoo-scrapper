Bug: 
Nandish reports:

If Symbol Length is either 1 or 5, it is not getting Earning Date.

In this following example, GOOGL symbol length is 5, we are not getting date. 
Same thing for symbols, T,F,X,V,M,C, it is not getting dates. 

Do you have any setup where I can update length 1 to 5 chars are valid. 

See bug sample output in bug.html

TODO:

I enabled php7 scalar types, but if "<?php declare(strict_types=1);" is used, exceptions are being thrown.
